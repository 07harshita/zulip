Zulip: Mastering streams and topics
-------------------
Hi {{name}},

One of the big things that's different about Zulip is this idea of "streams" and "topics".

While they take a little getting used to, once you get the hang of them, they're really powerful.

Some tips:

* Would you make a mailing list for something? If so, it should probably be a stream.

* Topics, on the other hand, are a lot more like subject lines - or conversations in Gmail

* The big difference: keep topics super-short and lightweight. One or two words will do it.

* Good topics: jQuery, Bug 345, lunch, zulip

* Bad topics: "What do people think of this?" "Where should we go to lunch?"

We're definitely eagerly awaiting your feedback, so please drop me a line if there's anything we can do to help.
