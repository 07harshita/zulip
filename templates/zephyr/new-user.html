    <p>Humbug is a little different than some chat systems you may have already
      used.<br />
      Here's what you need to know:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Every message has a <b>stream</b> and a <b>subject</b></li>
      <li>A stream is kind of like a mailing list -- it represents a group of people -- and anyone can <i>subscribe</i> to a stream and start getting traffic there</li>
      <li>A subject, on the other hand, is what the message is <i>actually about</i></li>
      <li>(You can, of course, send private messages.)</li>
      <li>All of these are displayed simultaneously, in an interleaved way, chronologically</li>
      <li>Time flows down, and the page does not automatically scroll</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This means we can have a conversation about git, jQuery,
      fundraising, where to go to lunch, and a message from your commit bot
      all simultaneously--without it getting unmanageable.</p>

    <h3>Let's take a look</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>Here, we have three conversations occurring simultaneously:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One on stream "humbug" with subject "Lunch", about where to go to lunch</li>
      <li>One on stream "humbug" with subject "Humbug testers", about early beta testers</li>
      <li>One automated notification on stream "commits", about a commit made to the repository</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some things to know</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"Enter" will start a reply to the message with the blue line by it (in the example above, the one with subject "Humbug testers")</li>
      <li>When you send the reply, it will appear at the very bottom of the stream (not directly below the message you reply to)</li>
      <li>After you're done typing a reply, you can send it with Tab followed by Enter (just pressing Enter will add a new line to the message)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>You're ready to go!</h3>
    <p>If you have any feedback, please, <a href="mailto:support@humbughq.com">send it our way</a>!</p>
