    <h2>Zephyr Mirroring for Humbug</h2>

<p>Thanks for giving Humbug a try!  This page describes how to use
  Humbug as to use MIT Zephyr; if you're not a current Zephyr user,
  you probably want to visit the main Humbug website.</p>

<p>There are a few steps you need to take to setup Humbug for your
MIT Zephyr account.</p>

<h3>First time setup</h3>
<ol>
  <li><p>Create a password and activate your account using the URL in
  your email.</p></li>

  <li><p>Get your API key from the "Settings" panel and put it in a file in your
    Athena home directory called <code>~/Private/.humbug-api-key</code>.</p></li>

  <li><p>Copy over your Zephyr subscriptions</p>

    <p> NOTE: Humbug does not currently support the equivalent of
    Barnowl filters; everything you subscribe to will be in your
    default view. If you have too many subscriptions (you know who you
    are), you may want to manually subscribe to just your main
    view. You can add or remove subscriptions from the Humbug app by
    clicking the gear in the upper right-hand corner and then
    selecting "Streams."</p>

    <p>If you would like to copy over all of your subscriptions, please
    run the following command:<br />
            <code>/mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py --sync-subscriptions</code></p>

    <p>After running the script, please reload Humbug to allow the changes to
    take effect.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Long-term setup</h3>
    <p>On an Athena dialup
    (<a href="https://linerva.mit.edu">linerva.mit.edu</a>,
     <a href="https://athena.dialup.mit.edu">athena.dialup.mit.edu</a>,
    etc.), run the Zephyr mirroring script inside a screen
    session.</p>

    <p><strong>IMPORTANT: You must keep the Zephyr mirroring script
    always running in a session with unexpired Kerberos
    tickets.</strong>  The script forwards personals you receive on
    Zephyr to Humbug, and forwards messages you send in Humbug to
    Zephyr.  <strong>If it is not running, only other Humbug users
    will receive messages you send from Humbug!</strong>.  The Humbug
    web application will warn you if the Zephyr mirroring script is
    not running.</p>

    <p>If you already have Barnowl running in screen/tmux somewhere,
    you can just run the command below inside that session.  If not,
    see <a href="https://sipb.mit.edu/doc/zephyr/">Running Barnowl in
    Screen</a> for an explanation of how to do this.<p>

    <p>To set up Zephyr mirroring, run: <br />
        <code>/mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py</code></p>

    <p>Don't run multiple copies of the Zephyr mirroring script;
    doing so will result in messages you sent being forwarded to
    Zephyr twice.</p>
