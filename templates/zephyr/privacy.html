<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Last modified: October 25, 2012</p>

<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and
share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content.
When you share information with us, for example by creating a Humbug Account,
we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search
results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others
quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re
using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
    <li>How we use that information.</li>
    <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar
with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about
these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Humbug so whether you are new to
Humbug or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our
practices – and if you have any questions contact us.</p>


<h3>Information we collect</h3>

<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from
figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things
like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you
online.</p>

<p>We collect information in two ways:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our
services require you to sign up for a Humbug Account. When you do, we’ll ask
for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or
credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we
offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Humbug Profile, which
may include your name and photo.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We
may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them,
like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view
and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Device information</strong></p>
<p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model,
operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network
information including phone number). Humbug may associate your device
identifiers or phone number with your Humbug Account.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Log information</strong></p>

<p>When you use our services or view content provided by Humbug, we may
automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This may
include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.</p></li>

<li><p>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number,
forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing
information and types of calls.</p></li>

<li><p>Internet protocol address.</p></li>

<li><p>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware
settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and
referral URL.</p></li>

<li><p>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Humbug
Account.</p></li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Location information</strong></p>
<p>When you use a location-enabled Humbug service, we may collect and process
information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile
device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as
sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on
nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Unique application numbers</strong></p>
<p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and
information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and
application version number) may be sent to Humbug when you install or uninstall
that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as
for automatic updates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Local storage</strong></p>
<p>We may collect and store information (including personal information)
locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including
HTML 5) and application data caches.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong></p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit
a Humbug service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous
identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when
you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising
services or Humbug features that may appear on other sites.</p>
</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>


<h3>How we use information we collect</h3>

<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide,
maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Humbug
and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content –
like giving you more relevant search results and ads.</p>

<p>We may use the name you provide for your Humbug Profile across all of the
services we offer that require a Humbug Account. In addition, we may replace
past names associated with your Humbug Account so that you are represented
consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email,
or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly
visible Humbug Profile information, such as your name and photo.</p>

<p>When you contact Humbug, we may keep a record of your communication to help
solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform
you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or
improvements.</p>

<p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel
tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services.
For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our
services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we
will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories,
such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.</p>

<p>We may combine personal information from one service with information,
including personal information, from other Humbug services – for example to
make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine
DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless
we have your opt-in consent.</p>

<p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other
than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Humbug processes personal information on our servers in many countries
around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located
outside the country where you live.</p>


<h3>Transparency and choice</h3>

<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what
information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is
used. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Humbug
Account by using Humbug Dashboard.</p></li>

<li><p>View and edit your ads preferences, such as which categories might
interest you, using the Ads Preferences Manager. You can also opt out of
certain Humbug advertising services here.</p></li>

<li><p>Use our editor to see and adjust how your Humbug Profile appears to
particular individuals.</p></li>

<li><p>Control who you share information with.</p></li>

<li><p>Take information out of many of our services.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies
associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us.
However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function
properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your
language preferences.</p>


<h3>Information you share</h3>

<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that
when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines,
including Humbug. Our services provide you with different options on sharing
and removing your content.</p>


<h3>Accessing and updating your personal information</h3>

<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your
personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways
to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information
for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal
information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your
request.</p>

<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require
disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or
fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or
would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information
residing on backup tapes).</p>

<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for
free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to
maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or
malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our
services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers
and may not remove information from our backup systems.</p>


<h3>Information we share</h3>

<p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and
individuals outside of Humbug unless one of the following circumstances
apply:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p><strong>With your consent</strong></p>
<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
individuals outside of Humbug when we have your consent to do so. We require
opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>With domain administrators</strong>

<p>If your Humbug Account is managed for you by a domain administrator (for
example, for Humbug Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers
who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Humbug
Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain
administrator may be able to:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding
applications you install.</p></li>

<li><p>change your account password.</p></li>

<li><p>suspend or terminate your account access.</p></li>

<li><p>access or retain information stored as part of your account.</p></li>

<li><p>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law,
regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.</p></li>

<li><p>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy
settings.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more
information.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p><strong>For external processing</strong></p>
<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted
businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in
compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality
and security measures.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>For legal reasons</strong></p>

<p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
individuals outside of Humbug if we have a good-faith belief that access, use,
preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable
governmental request.</p></li>

<li><p>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
potential violations.</p></li>

<li><p>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical
issues.</p></li>

<li><p>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Humbug, our
users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p></li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly
and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For
example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use
of our services.</p>

<p>If Humbug is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will
continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give
affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes
subject to a different privacy policy.</p>


<h3>Information security</h3>

<p>We work hard to protect Humbug and our users from unauthorized access to or
unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In
particular:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>We encrypt many of our services using SSL.</p></li>

<li><p>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices,
including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to
systems.</p></li>

<li><p>We restrict access to personal information to Humbug employees,
contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it
for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations
and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these
obligations.</p></li>

</ul>


<h3>Application</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Humbug Inc. and
its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our
advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy
policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or
individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search
results, sites that may include Humbug services, or other sites linked from our
services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other
companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use
cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads.</p>


<h3>Enforcement</h3>

<p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere
to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal written
complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We
work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data
protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of
personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>


<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your
rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post
any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we
will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email
notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of
this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>
