A great open source project needs a great group chat service.  Here's
why we think Zulip is the best choice you can make today.

(Psst, I'll spoil the ending: not only is Zulip itself open source,
but hosting on zulipchat.com is free for open source projects.

## Great for developers

* Messages take Markdown formatting, [including code
  blocks](/help/format-your-message-using-markdown#code), making it
  super easy to discuss some code or paste an error message.

* Have a design discussion in chat and want to link to it in your bug
  tracker or a commit message?  [Two
  clicks](/help/share-a-message-or-conversation) makes a permanent
  link.  The URL transparently shows where the discussion happened,
  and for everyone who clicks through, Zulip's topic threading
  provides a focused view on that conversation.

* Want to refer to issues or code reviews with short notation like
  `#1234`, `T1234` -- or any other style of your own?  Set up any
  regex as a [custom linkification
  filter](/help/add-a-custom-linkification-filter) for your
  organization.

* Troubleshooting in chat for users or new developers becomes much
  more manageable with Zulip's topic threading: each issue in a
  channel can be discussed in its own thread.

## Great for productivity

* With Zulip's unique model of threading by topic, your community can
  have more than one conversation in a channel at the same time,
  without the confusion and talking-over caused by traditional models
  like IRC and Slack.  (Extra handy for holding a synchronous chat
  meeting with 5-20 people and making good use of everyone's time!)

* No limited "try it out" tier -- [host it
  yourself](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prod-install.html),
  or [sign up at zulipchat.com](https://zulipchat.com/beta/) for
  commercially-supported hosting, free for open source projects.

* Fast, full-text search through your full, unlimited message history.

* [Stop by
  chat.zulip.org](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chat-zulip-org.html),
  Zulip's own development community, to see it in action for a large
  project with ~5000 messages/week, essentially all of it productive
  developer discussion.

## Great for open communities

* Sleek, modern [apps for every platform](/apps/) make Zulip an
  inclusive choice for everyone in your community.

* Take down the barrier to participation created by making people
  interested in your community ask for an invitation before they can
  enter -- [one
  checkbox](/help/allow-anyone-to-join-without-an-invitation) opens
  your Zulip organization for anyone to join.

* Want to link to your Zulip organization with a nice badge in your
  README?  [Done.](/help/join-zulip-chat-badge)

<!--- This needs better documentation. -->
* GitHub auth?  [We've got that.][github-auth]

[github-auth]: https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/7e9926233/zproject/prod_settings_template.py#L112

* Zulip scales well to large communities -- it's loved by communities
  as large as 1000 users and beyond.

## Zulip ❤​ open source

* Zulip itself is open source, [under the Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/blob/master/LICENSE).

* Full, commercially-supported hosting at zulipchat.com is **free**
  for open source communities.  [Sign up today!](https://zulipchat.com/beta/))

<!--- This needs better -- any! -- documentation. -->
* Your data is yours -- Zulip's high-quality export and import tools
  enable migrating a community smoothly from one host to another.
  So if you start out running on zulipchat.com, you can always choose
  later to move to your own servers, and vice versa.

* Zulip is the leading open source group chat option, with far more
  contributor momentum than any other.  Some numbers:

   * Over 300 contributors in the Zulip server project alone -- a
     figure reached in only 18 months.

   * 75 people working on Zulip at the PyCon sprints in Portland in
     May 2017.

   * In the [Zulip Server 1.6
     release](https://blog.zulip.org/2017/06/06/zulip-server-1-6-released/)
     in June 2017, over 3100 new commits since 1.5, by over 150
     different people.
