# Enable full width display

By default, Zulip limits how wide the center message pane because it's
easier and faster to read paragraphs that don't have extremely long
lines (which is why most news sites and blogs also limit paragraph
width).  We also offer an option to configure Zulip to use the full
width of wide screens.

### Enable full width display

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|display-settings}

2. Under **Display settings**, select **Use full width on wide screens**.

{end_tabs}
