Hello,

Thanks for agreeing to help test out Humbug.

There are a few steps you need to take to ensure Humbug works with your
MIT Zephyr account.

 1) Create a password and activate your account:
        <{{ activate_url }}>

 2) Get your API key from the "Settings" panel and put it in your
    Athena home directory at ~/Private/.humbug-api-key.

 3) Copy over your Zephyr subscriptions by running the command below:
        /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py --sync-subscriptions

 4) Run the Zephyr mirroring script on a server with long-lived tickets.
        /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py

    The script copies personals you receive on Zephyr to Humbug, and
    copies messages you send from Humbug to Zephyr. You should keep this
    script always running in a session with Kerberos tickets.

    You may want to run this with owl-screen or kchen's
    cont-renew-notify.


 5) Visit the running app at:
        <https://humbughq.com/>

Feel free to send us a message via the Feedback button from within the
app if you have any questions or encounter any problems.


Cheers,

Jeff, Waseem, Jessica, Tim, Keegan, Luke, and Zev
