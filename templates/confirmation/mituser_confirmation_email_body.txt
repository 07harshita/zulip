Hello,

Thanks for giving Humbug a try!

There are a few steps you need to take to ensure Humbug works with your
MIT Zephyr account.

 1) Create a password and activate your account:
        <{{ activate_url }}>

 2) Get your API key from the "Settings" panel and put it in a file in your
    Athena home directory called ~/Private/.humbug-api-key .

 3) Copy over your Zephyr subscriptions

    NOTE: Humbug does not currently support filters; everything you subscribe
    to will be in your default view. If you have too many subscriptions (you
    know who you are), you may want to manually subscribe to just your main
    view. You can add or remove subscriptions from the Humbug app by clicking
    the gear in the upper right-hand corner and then selecting "Streams."

    If you would like to copy over all of your subscriptions, please run the
    command below:
            /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py --sync-subscriptions

    After running the script, please reload Humbug to allow the changes to
    take effect.

 4) On an Athena dialup (linerva.mit.edu, scrubbing-bubbles.mit.edu, etc),
    run the Zephyr mirroring script.

    IMPORTANT: You must keep this script always running in a session
    with unexpired Kerberos tickets.  The script forwards personals
    you receive on Zephyr to Humbug, and forwards messages you send in
    Humbug to Zephyr.

    If you already have Barnowl running in screen/tmux somewhere, you can just
    run the command below inside that session. If not, see "Running Barnowl in
    Screen" at <http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/zephyr/> for an explanation.

    To set up Zephyr mirroring, run:
        /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py

 5) Visit the running app at:
        <https://humbughq.com/>
