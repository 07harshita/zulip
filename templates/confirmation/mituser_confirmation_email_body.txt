Hello,

Thanks for giving Humbug a try!

There are a few steps you need to take to ensure Humbug works with your
MIT Zephyr account.

 1) Create a password and activate your account:
        <{{ activate_url }}>

 2) Get your API key from the "Settings" panel and put it in your
    Athena home directory at ~/Private/.humbug-api-key.

 3) Copy over your Zephyr subscriptions

    NOTE: Humbug does not currently support filters; everything you subscribe
    to will be in your default view. If you have too many subscriptions (you
    know who you are), you may want to manually subscribe to just your main
    view via the "Subscriptions" tab in Humbug.

    If you would like to copy over all of your subscriptions, please run the
    command below:
            /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py --sync-subscriptions

    After running the script, please reload Humbug to allow the changes to
    take effect.

 4) On an Athena dialup (linerva.mit.edu, scrubbing-bubbles.mit.edu, etc),
    run the Zephyr mirroring script.

    The script copies personals you receive on Zephyr to Humbug, and
    copies messages you send from Humbug to Zephyr. You should keep this
    script always running in a session with Kerberos tickets.

    If you already have Barnowl running in screen/tmux somewhere, you can just
    run the command below inside that session. If not, see "Running Barnowl in
    Screen" at <http://sipb.mit.edu/doc/zephyr/> for an explanation.

    To set up Zephyr mirroring, run:
        /mit/tabbott/humbug/zephyr_mirror.py

 5) Visit the running app at:
        <https://humbughq.com/>

Feel free to send us a message via the Feedback button from within the
app if you have any questions or encounter any problems.


Cheers,

Jeff, Waseem, Jessica, Tim, Keegan, Luke, and Zev
